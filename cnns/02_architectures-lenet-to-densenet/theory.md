## 1. The Architectural Evolution Timeline

```
1998  LeNet-5         First successful CNN — digit recognition (MNIST)
                       7 layers, ~60K parameters

2012  AlexNet          ImageNet breakthrough — 8 layers, ~60M parameters
                       ReLU, Dropout, GPU training, won ILSVRC by huge margin

2014  VGGNet           Very deep (16-19 layers) using ONLY 3×3 convolutions
                       ~138M parameters — showed depth matters more than
                       kernel size or hand-tuned receptive fields

2014  GoogLeNet         22 layers but only ~5M parameters via Inception
        (Inception)    modules — multi-scale feature extraction in parallel

2015  ResNet            Up to 152 layers using residual/skip connections —
                       solved the vanishing gradient problem for very deep nets,
                       won ILSVRC 2015

2016  DenseNet          Dense connections (concatenation, not addition) —
                       maximal feature reuse, fewer parameters than ResNet
                       for comparable accuracy
```

**The core throughline:** each architecture solves a specific limitation of
its predecessor — AlexNet showed scale+GPU+ReLU works; VGGNet showed
uniform depth with small kernels works even better; GoogLeNet showed you
don't need huge parameter counts if you're clever about multi-scale
processing; ResNet showed depth alone eventually breaks optimization unless
you add skip connections; DenseNet pushed feature reuse to its logical extreme.

## 2. LeNet-5 (1998)

**Paper:** LeCun, Bottou, Bengio, Haffner — "Gradient-Based Learning Applied
to Document Recognition"

### Architecture

```
Input (1×32×32)
   │
   ▼
Conv(6, 5×5, s=1)  →  28×28×6        [C1]
   │
   ▼
AvgPool(2×2, s=2)  →  14×14×6        [S2]
   │
   ▼
Conv(16, 5×5, s=1) →  10×10×16       [C3]
   │
   ▼
AvgPool(2×2, s=2)  →  5×5×16         [S4]
   │
   ▼
Flatten            →  400
   │
   ▼
FC(120) → Tanh                       [C5]
   │
   ▼
FC(84) → Tanh                        [F6]
   │
   ▼
FC(10) → Softmax                     [Output]
```

### Key Design Choices (Historical Context)

```
Activation: Tanh / Sigmoid (ReLU not yet popularized in 1998)
Pooling:    Average pooling (max pooling less common at the time)
Purpose:    Handwritten digit recognition for postal/bank check processing
Parameters: ~60,000 — tiny by modern standards, but groundbreaking then
```

**Why it mattered:** LeNet-5 was the first architecture to combine
convolution + pooling + fully-connected layers trained end-to-end with
backpropagation, demonstrating that CNNs could outperform hand-engineered
feature extraction + classical classifiers (e.g., SVMs on hand-crafted
features) for image recognition. However, it was largely ignored outside
niche applications for over a decade due to insufficient compute for larger
problems and the lack of large labeled datasets.

## 3. AlexNet (2012)

**Paper:** Krizhevsky, Sutskever, Hinton — "ImageNet Classification with Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks"

### Architecture (Simplified — single-GPU equivalent)

```
Input (3×224×224)
   │
   ▼
Conv(96, 11×11, s=4) → ReLU → 55×55×96
   │
   ▼
MaxPool(3×3, s=2) → 27×27×96
   │
   ▼
Conv(256, 5×5, s=1, p=2) → ReLU → 27×27×256
   │
   ▼

   │
   ▼
FC(4096) → ReLU → Dropout(0.5)
   │
   ▼
FC(1000) → Softmax
```

### Key Innovations Over LeNet

```
1. ReLU instead of Tanh/Sigmoid
   → Solved vanishing gradient for deeper nets; trained 6× faster than
     equivalent tanh network (per the original paper's own benchmark)

2. Dropout (0.5) in fully-connected layers
   → First major use of dropout to combat overfitting in a deep CNN with
     60M parameters on "only" 1.2M training images

3. Overlapping Max Pooling (kernel > stride, e.g., 3×3 pool with stride 2)
   → Slight accuracy improvement over non-overlapping pooling

4. Local Response Normalization (LRN) — since superseded by BatchNorm
   → Normalized responses across nearby channels; rarely used today

5. Data Augmentation (random crops, horizontal flips, color jittering)
   → Effectively multiplied the training set size, reducing overfitting

6. GPU Training (2× NVIDIA GTX 580 GPUs)
   → Made training a network of this scale computationally feasible;
     arguably AlexNet's biggest practical contribution was PROVING
     GPU-accelerated deep learning could work at scale
```

**Why it mattered:** AlexNet's 2012 ILSVRC win (15.3% top-5 error vs. 26.2%
for the second place, a non-deep-learning method) is widely considered the
event that triggered the modern deep learning revolution, redirecting
massive research investment toward CNNs.

## 4. VGGNet (2014)

**Paper:** Simonyan & Zisserman — "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for
Large-Scale Image Recognition"

### Architecture Philosophy: Uniformity

VGGNet's defining choice: use ONLY 3×3 convolutions (stride 1, padding 1,
same-padding) and 2×2 max pooling (stride 2) throughout the ENTIRE network,
varying only depth and channel count.

### VGG-16 Configuration

```
Block 1: Conv(64,3×3) → Conv(64,3×3) → MaxPool        224→112
Block 2: Conv(128,3×3) → Conv(128,3×3) → MaxPool       112→56
Block 3: Conv(256,3×3) → Conv(256,3×3) → Conv(256,3×3) → MaxPool   56→28
Block 4: Conv(512,3×3) → Conv(512,3×3) → Conv(512,3×3) → MaxPool   28→14
Block 5: Conv(512,3×3) → Conv(512,3×3) → Conv(512,3×3) → MaxPool   14→7
         Flatten → FC(4096) → FC(4096) → FC(1000)

Total: 13 conv layers + 3 FC layers = 16 weight layers ("VGG-16")
       (VGG-19 adds one more conv layer to blocks 3,4,5 → 19 weight layers)
```

### Why Only 3×3 Kernels?

As derived in Topic 1 §9, stacking THREE 3×3 convolutions achieves the same
7×7 receptive field as a single 7×7 convolution, using only `27C²` parameters
vs. `49C²` — roughly 55% the parameter count — while also inserting two
EXTRA non-linearities (ReLU after each conv) along the way, increasing the
network's expressive power for the same receptive field.

### Why It Mattered

VGGNet demonstrated that network DEPTH (not exotic kernel sizes or unusual
operations) is a primary driver of representational power, sparking a wave
of "just make it deeper" research. Its simple, uniform, repeatable block
structure also became the template for the "stage/block" design pattern
used by virtually every architecture since (including ResNet and DenseNet
below).

**Drawback:** ~138 million parameters (mostly in the FC layers) made VGGNet
large and slow, motivating GoogLeNet's parameter-efficient parallel design.

---

## 5. GoogLeNet / Inception (2014)

**Paper:** Szegedy et al. — "Going Deeper with Convolutions"

### The Inception Module

Instead of choosing a SINGLE kernel size per layer, an Inception module
applies SEVERAL kernel sizes IN PARALLEL to the same input and concatenates
the results — letting the network learn which scale of feature is useful at
each stage, rather than the architect having to guess.

```
                         Input
                           │
        ┌──────────┬───────┴───────┬──────────┐
        │           │               │          │
     1×1 conv    1×1 conv        1×1 conv    MaxPool 3×3
        │           │               │          │
        │        3×3 conv        5×5 conv      │
        │           │               │       1×1 conv
        │           │               │          │
        └──────────┴───────┬───────┴──────────┘
                            │
                    Concatenate (channel-wise)
                            │
                          Output
```

### The Role of 1×1 Convolutions ("Bottleneck")

```
A 1×1 convolution does NOT look at any spatial neighborhood — it operates
purely across the CHANNEL dimension at each pixel independently:

  Y[k,i,j] = Σ_c W[k,c] · X[c,i,j] + b[k]      (a per-pixel linear projection)

Used here for DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION before the expensive 3×3/5×5 convs:

  Without 1×1 reduction: 5×5 conv directly on 256 channels →256×256×25 ≈ 1.64M params
  With 1×1 reduction:    256→64 (1×1) then 64→256 (5×5)   → 256×64 + 64×256×25 ≈ 0.42M params
                          (≈3.9× fewer parameters for a comparable effective operation)
```

This bottleneck design is what allows GoogLeNet to be DEEPER (22 layers) than
AlexNet while having roughly 12× FEWER parameters (~5M vs ~60M).

### Auxiliary Classifiers

GoogLeNet attaches two extra "auxiliary" softmax classifiers at intermediate
depths during TRAINING ONLY (removed at inference). These inject additional
gradient signal directly into earlier layers, combating vanishing gradients
in this very deep (for 2014) 22-layer network — a precursor to the deeper
motivation behind ResNet's skip connections one year later.

### Why It Mattered

GoogLeNet proved that thoughtful architectural design (multi-scale parallel
processing + aggressive dimensionality reduction) could achieve BETTER
accuracy than VGGNet with a small fraction of the parameters and computation
— shifting the field's focus from "bigger is better" toward "smarter design
matters more than raw parameter count."

## 6. ResNet (2015)

**Paper:** He, Zhang, Ren, Sun — "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"

### The Problem: Degradation in Very Deep Networks

Beyond a certain depth (empirically, beyond ~20-30 layers for plain
stacked-conv networks of the VGG style), adding MORE layers actually
INCREASES training error — not due to overfitting (training error itself
gets worse), but due to OPTIMIZATION DIFFICULTY: extremely deep networks
become hard to train even though, in principle, a deeper network could
always at least match a shallower one (by learning identity mappings in the
extra layers).

### The Residual Block

```
        x
        │
        ├─────────────────────┐
        │                       │ (identity skip connection)
        ▼                       │
     Conv(3×3) → BN → ReLU       │
        │                       │
        ▼                       │
     Conv(3×3) → BN              │
        │                       │
        ▼                       │
       (+) ◄─────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
      ReLU
        │
        ▼
     output = F(x) + x
```

### The Mathematical Insight

Instead of forcing each block to learn the FULL desired transformation
`H(x)`, a residual block learns only the RESIDUAL `F(x) = H(x) − x`, and the
final output is `F(x) + x`.

```
If the optimal transformation for this block IS approximately the identity
(H(x) ≈ x), then F(x) only needs to learn to output ≈0 — which is MUCH
easier for gradient descent to discover than learning an exact identity
mapping through a stack of non-linear conv+ReLU layers (ReLU especially
makes exact identity mappings hard to represent precisely).
```

### Why Skip Connections Solve Vanishing Gradients

During backpropagation, the gradient flowing backward through a residual
block is:

```
∂L/∂x = ∂L/∂output · (∂F/∂x + 1)
                              ↑ the "+1" comes directly from the skip connection

Even if ∂F/∂x → 0 (the convolutional path's gradient vanishes), the gradient
∂L/∂x still receives the FULL upstream gradient via the "+1" term — the skip
connection acts as a "gradient superhighway" that bypasses the
potentially-vanishing conv path entirely.
```

This is why ResNets could be successfully trained at depths of 50, 101, and
even 152 layers — depths that caused plain (non-residual) networks to fail
to train effectively.

### Bottleneck Blocks (ResNet-50+)

For deeper variants, a 3-layer "bottleneck" block reduces computation:

```
1×1 conv (reduce channels, e.g. 256→64)
3×3 conv (process at reduced width, 64→64)
1×1 conv (restore channels, 64→256)
+ skip connection
```

This achieves a similar parameter-reduction benefit to GoogLeNet's
bottleneck philosophy, applied within the residual-learning framework.

### Why It Mattered

ResNet made networks of unprecedented depth (152+ layers) not just possible
but PRACTICAL to train, winning ILSVRC 2015 by a large margin and becoming
the most widely adopted backbone architecture in computer vision for years
afterward — the residual connection concept has since been adopted far
beyond CNNs, appearing in Transformers (Phase 4) as a core architectural
element.

## 7. DenseNet (2016)

**Paper:** Huang, Liu, van der Maaten, Weinberger — "Densely Connected
Convolutional Networks"

### The Dense Block: Concatenation, Not Addition

```
        x₀
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   │  Layer 1│──► x₁ = H₁([x₀])
   └────┬────┘
        │  (concat x₀,x₁)
   ┌────┴────┐
   │  Layer 2│──► x₂ = H₂([x₀,x₁])
   └────┬────┘
        │  (concat x₀,x₁,x₂)
   ┌────┴────┐
   │  Layer 3│──► x₃ = H₃([x₀,x₁,x₂])
   └─────────┘

Each layer receives the CONCATENATION of ALL previous layers' outputs as
input (not just the immediately preceding layer), and its own output is
similarly concatenated for all FUTURE layers to use.
```

### Why Concatenation Instead of Addition (ResNet-style)?

```
ResNet:    x_{l+1} = x_l + F(x_l)               ← SUMS features (same dims required)
DenseNet:  x_{l+1} = [x_0, x_1, ..., x_l, H(x_l)] ← CONCATENATES features (grows channel dim)

Addition can cause information loss: summing two feature maps can create
INTERFERENCE (positive and negative values cancelling), potentially
destroying useful information from either path.

Concatenation preserves ALL information from every layer explicitly,
giving every later layer direct, undiminished access to every earlier
layer's features — maximal feature reuse, no interference.
```

### Growth Rate (k)

Each layer in a dense block adds exactly `k` new feature channels (the
"growth rate," typically `k=12` to `32`). After `L` layers in a block, the
input channel count for the LAST layer is `k₀ + (L−1)×k` (where `k₀` is the
initial channel count) — growing linearly with depth, hence "DenseNet."

### Transition Layers

Between dense blocks, a **transition layer** (1×1 conv + average pooling)
reduces both channel count and spatial dimensions, preventing the
concatenated feature maps from growing unboundedly across the whole network.

```
Dense Block 1 → Transition (1×1 conv, halve channels + AvgPool, halve H×W) →
Dense Block 2 → Transition → Dense Block 3 → ... → Global AvgPool → FC
```

### Parameter Efficiency

Because every layer has direct access to all preceding feature maps, each
individual layer can be NARROWER (fewer output channels per layer — small
growth rate `k`) while the network still maintains a rich, high-dimensional
feature representation cumulatively. This is why DenseNet often matches or
exceeds ResNet's accuracy with FEWER total parameters.

### Why It Mattered

DenseNet pushed the "skip connection" idea from ResNet to its logical
extreme — instead of skipping ONE block backward, why not connect EVERY
layer to EVERY future layer? This maximizes gradient flow (every layer has
a short, direct path to the loss) and feature reuse, achieving strong
accuracy-per-parameter efficiency, though at the cost of higher MEMORY usage
during training (must store all concatenated feature maps simultaneously).
